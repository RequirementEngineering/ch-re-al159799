  ## 1. Introduction ##
 
  ### 1.1 Purpose 
  
The purpose of this project is to design a system and give the user an order regarding the information stored in their gym, you can access it, modify it and update it, all this because they do not have a software with these capabilities, until now they are saving their information in handwritten notes or notes on the computer.
  
  ### 1.2 Scope
  
The software will have the capacity to store information given by the user thanks to an interface connected to a local database, this will allow you to:
  
 + Save information from clients who come to the gym.
 + It will have the ability to show when one of these customers has a debt.
 
 Also with regard to the gym equipment:
 
 + Have a record of the machines used.

  ### 1.4 Reference
  
  
  
  ### 1.5 Overview
  
The next sections of the document will contain information about the system, divided in two sections, section 2 will give a overall description, containing the functions, constrains and the people involved. Section 3 will give all the specific requirements that the system should deliver.
  
  ## 2. Overall Description ##
  
  ### 2.1 Product perspective
  
  The system consist in a software for the user, capable of save information into a data base working localy, with the options of create, modify or delete the information, all of these whit the interface that will be conected to the data base.
  
  ### 2.2 Product functions
  
  These are the functions that the system should do:
  
* Employee
   * Add a new customer to the systme.
   * Once the customer is on the system, the user can see his information and modify it and also see if he has a debt.
   * Delete a customer.
